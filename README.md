# ar_charts

A Flutter charts library (line and bar charts) for Android and iOS.

## About

This plugin is a **wrapper** around two well-known native chart libraries:

- **iOS**: [Charts](https://github.com/ChartsOrg/Charts) (ChartsOrg/Charts) — the Apple-side counterpart of MPAndroidChart.
- **Android**: [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) (PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) — the Android chart library.

## Getting Started

Add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ar_charts: ^0.0.1
```

Or use a Git dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ar_charts:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/anisrehman/ar_charts.git
      ref: main
```

See the `example` app in this repository for usage. For Flutter plugin development, see the [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/to/develop-plugins).
